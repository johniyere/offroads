# Offroads

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

The aim of this project is to create a website where a user can view a trail (off-road) running route in specific areas, these routes can be provided with details of how long it is, the difficulty, where to park, etc. Once they have run a route they can log their time and compete against other users who have also completed it. A rating system for routes could be implemented so that new runners can determine which routes are the best in a particular area and level. A map with the routes outline should also be provided. If a member runs a new route which is not on the website already then they should be able to create it and upload it to the site for others to try out.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
